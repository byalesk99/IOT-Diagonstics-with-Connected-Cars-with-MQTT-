# IOT-Diagonstics-with-Connected-Cars-with-MQTT-
Internet of things (IoT) is a relatively new concept identifying various computing devices connected over the internet, differentiated by unique identifiers (IP). Considering the IoT protocols (CoAP, MQTT) as becoming more mature, there is still no generally accepted solution for intelligent management of these devices, though several initiatives are present. Our aim is to demonstrate the versatility of these technologies by implementing a special use-case related to the automotive world, emphasizing the connection between IoT and the connected car. We have chosen the field of automotive diagnostics for our demonstrator considering it represents a crucial path for future intelligent transportation systems.
